This lesson is adapted from the [Data Carpentry Ecology Lessons 1](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html) and [Data Carpentry Ecology Lessons 2](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html)

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. e.g.

```{r}
3 + 5
```

Execute code chunks by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** or OS X: **Cmd + Shift + Enter**. To execute a specific line within a code chunk, placing your cursor on that line and pressing **Ctrl + Enter** or OS X: **Cmd + Enter**. e.g.

Add a new chunk of code in your language of choice by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing **Ctrl + Alt + I** or OS X: **Cmd + Option + I**.

```{r}
3 * 2
```

**TIP**: The R Markdown notebook (e.g. *'Intro_to_R.Rmd'*) can be viewed or edited in either in *'Source'* mode which shows the raw Markdown commands, or in the *'Visual'* mode which shows how the Markdown will look in its formatted form. You can switch between the *'Source'* and *'Visual'* modes at any time using the tabs at the top of the notebook.

**TIP**: When you save the notebook, a HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the Preview button or press Ctrl + Shift + K or OS X: Cmd + Shift + K to preview the HTML file in the 'Viewer' tab). The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike Knit, Preview does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## 1. Objects in R

### 1.1 Creating objects in R

You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console (having space between operators is optional):

```{r}
12 / 7
```

However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign *values* to *objects*. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the assignment operator `<-`, and the value we want to give it:

```{r}
weight_kg <- 55
```

`<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to objects on the left. So, after executing `x <- 3`, the value of `x` is `3`. The arrow can be read as 3 **goes into** `x`.\

For historical reasons, you can also use `=` for assignments, but not in every context. *Note* `<-` assigns values to your global environment, i.e. they can be used throughout your scripts.

::: {style="background-color:#E4F8D6"}
**TIP**: In RStudio, typing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> will write `<-` in a single keystroke in a PC, while typing <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> does the same in a Mac.
:::

::: {style="background-color:#E9E2FF"}
### 1.2 Naming objects *(extra material)*

-   objects can have any name, e.g. `x`, `id`, `new_id`
-   they **cannot** start with a number, `2x` is not valid, but `x2` is
-   R is case sensitive so `id` is different from `ID`
-   there are some reserved names, e.g., `if`, `else`, `for` (see [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) for a complete list)
-   It's good to avoid dots (`.`) within names. Many function names in R itself have them and dots also have a special meaning (methods) in R and other programming languages.
-   recommended to use nouns for object names, and verbs for function names.
:::

### 1.3 Objects vs. variables

What are known as `objects` in `R` are known as `variables` in many other programming languages. Depending on the context, `object` and `variable` can have drastically different meanings. However, in this lesson, the two words are used synonymously. For more information see: <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects>

When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:

```{r}
weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_kg <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
```

```{r}
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object
```

::: {style="background-color:#E4F8D6"}
**TIP**: In the *Environment* tab you can see the current values for variables in memory.
:::

Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):

```{r}
2.2 * weight_kg
```

We can change an object's value by assigning it a new one:

```{r}
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

This means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of other objects For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new object, `weight_lb`:

```{r}
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

```{r}
weight_kg <- 100
```

::: {style="background-color:#E4F8D6"}
**Question:** What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 220?
:::

Let's see the answer:

```{r}
weight_lb
```

### 1.4 Comments

The comment character in R is `#`, anything to the right of a `#` in a script will be ignored by R. It is useful to leave notes and explanations in your scripts.

::: {style="background-color:#E4F8D6"}
**TIP**: RStudio makes it easy to comment or uncomment a paragraph: after selecting the lines you want to comment, press at the same time on your keyboard <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. If you only want to comment out one line, you can put the cursor at any location of that line (i.e. no need to select the whole line), then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
:::

## 2. Functions and their arguments

Functions are "canned scripts" that automate more complicated sets of commands including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be made available by importing R **packages**.

A function usually takes one or more inputs called **arguments**. Functions often (but not always) return a **value**.

A typical example would be the function `sqrt()`. The input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact, the output) is the square root of that number. Executing a function ('running it') is called **calling** the function. An example of a function call is:

```{r}
ten <- sqrt(weight_kg)
```

Here, the value of `weight_kg`is given to the `sqrt()` function, the `sqrt()` function calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to the object `ten`. This function is very simple, because it takes just one argument.

The **return 'value'** of a function need not be numerical (like that of `sqrt()`), and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or even a dataset. We'll see that when we read data files into R.

**Arguments** can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be looked up in the documentation (see below).

Some functions take arguments which may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a *default* value: these are called *options*. Options are typically used to alter the way the function operates, such as whether it ignores 'bad values', or what symbol to use in a plot. However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value of your choice which will be used instead of the default.

Let's try a function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.

```{r}
round(3.14159)
```

Here, we've called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it has returned the value `3`. That's because the default is to round to the nearest whole number. If we want more digits we can see how to do that by getting information about the `round` function. We can use `args(round)` to find what arguments it takes, or look at the help for this function using `?round`.

```{r}
args(round)
```

```{r}
?round
```

::: {style="background-color:#E4F8D6"}
**TIP**: In the *Help* tab you can see the help that you just called
:::

We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can type `digits = 2` or however many we want.

```{r}
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
```

If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you don't have to name them:

```{r}
round(3.14159, 2)
```

And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:

```{r}
round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)
```

::: {style="background-color:#E4F8D6"}
**TIP**: It's good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you're rounding) first in your function call, and to then specify the names of all optional arguments. If you don't, someone reading your code might have to look up the definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you're doing.
:::

## 3. Vectors and data types

### 3.1. Defining vectors

A vector is the most common and basic data type in R, and is pretty much the workhorse of R. A vector is composed by a series of values, which can be either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using the `c()` function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign it to a new object `weight_g`:

```{r}
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g
```

A vector can also contain characters:

```{r}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals
```

The quotes around "mouse", "rat", etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R will assume objects have been created called `mouse`, `rat` and `dog`. As these objects don't exist in R's memory, there will be an error message.

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:

```{r}
length(weight_g)
length(animals)
```

### 3.2 Vector types

An important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data. The function `class()` indicates the class (the type of element) of an object:

```{r}
class(weight_g)
class(animals)
```

::: {style="background-color:#E4F8D6"}
**TIP**: In the *Environment* tab you can see the type for vectors in memory.
:::

The function `str()` provides an overview of the structure of an object and its elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex objects:

```{r}
str(weight_g)
str(animals)
```

### 3.3 Adding elements to vectors

You can use the `c()` function to add other elements to your vector:

```{r}
weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector
weight_g
```

In the first line, we take the original vector `weight_g`, add the value `90` to the end of it, and save the result back into `weight_g`. Then we add the value `30` to the beginning, again saving the result back into `weight_g`.

We can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset. As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or calculating.

### 3.4. Atomic Vectors

An **atomic vector** is the simplest R **data type** and is a linear vector of a single type. Above, we saw 2 of the 6 main **atomic vector** types that R uses: `"character"` and `"numeric"` (or `"double"`). These are the basic building blocks that all R objects are built from. The other 4 **atomic vector** types are:

-   `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
-   `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g., `2L`, the `L` indicates to R that it's an integer)
-   `"complex"` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., `1 + 4i`) and that's all we're going to say about them
-   `"raw"` for bitstreams that we won't discuss further

You can check the type of your vector using the `typeof()` function and inputting your vector as the argument.

::: {style="background-color:#E9E2FF"}
**Extra material** Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that R uses. Other important ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames (`data.frame`), factors (`factor`) and arrays (`array`).
:::

## 4. Subsetting vectors

### 4.1. Square bracket notation

If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one or several indices in square brackets. For instance:

```{r}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

::: {style="background-color:#E9E2FF"}
**Extra material** - We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the original one:

```{r}
more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

### 4.2. Indexing - *Important!*

R indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, and R start counting at 1, because that's what human beings typically do.

Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that's simpler for computers to do.

### 4.3 Conditional subsetting of vectors

Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. `TRUE` will select the element with the same index, while `FALSE` will not:

```{r }
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the values above 50:

```{r }
weight_g > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]
```

You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true, AND) or `|` (at least one of the conditions is true, OR):

```{r }
weight_g[weight_g < 30 | weight_g > 50]
```

Here, `<` stands for "less than", `>` for "greater than", `>=` for "greater than or equal to", and `==` for "equal to". The double equal sign `==` is a test for numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be confused with the single `=` sign, which performs variable assignment (similar to `<-`).

::: {style="background-color:#E9E2FF"}
**Extra material** - another example

```{r }
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

### 4.4 Searching for strings in a vector

A common task is to search for certain strings in a vector. One could use the "or" operator `|` to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly become tedious. The function `%in%` allows you to test if any of the elements of a search vector are found:

```{r }
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"] # returns both rat and cat
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")]
```

## 5. Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data (which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented in vectors as `NA`.

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data you are working with include missing values. This feature makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data. You can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate the result while ignoring the missing values.

```{r}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
max(heights)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See below for examples.

```{r}
## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]
```

::: {style="background-color:#E9E2FF"}
**Extra material**

```{r}
## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed. The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or `"double"`).
na.omit(heights)
## Extract those elements which are complete cases. The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or `"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
```

Recall that you can use the `typeof()` function to find the type of your atomic vector.

Note that data should only ever be removed if there is a valid reason to do so.
:::

## 6. Data Frames

### 6.1 What is a Data Frame?

Data frames are the *de facto* data structure for most tabular data in R, and what we use for statistics and plotting.

A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the functions `read.csv()` or `read_csv()` (tidyverse version); in other words, when importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers, factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson/master/img/data-frame.svg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6.2 Downloading some data and loading it into a Data Frame

We are going to use the R function `download.file()` to download the CSV file that contains the survey data from Figshare, and we will use `read.csv()` to load into memory the content of the CSV file as an object of class `data.frame`.

Inside the download.file command, the first entry is a character string with the source URL ("<https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169>"). This source URL downloads a CSV file from figshare. The text after the comma ("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv") is the destination of the file on your local machine. You'll need to have a folder on your machine called "data_raw" where you'll download the file. So this command downloads a file from Figshare, names it "portal_data_joined.csv" and adds it to a preexisting folder named "data_raw".

```{r}
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

You are now ready to load the data into a Data Fame.

```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

This statement doesn't produce any output because, as you might recall, assignments don't display anything. If we want to check that our data has been loaded, we can see the contents of the data frame by typing its name: `surveys`.

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
surveys
```

Wow... that was a lot of output. At least it means the data loaded properly.

### 6.3 Inspecting`data.frame` Objects

Let's check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame using the function `head()`:

```{r}
head(surveys)
```

```{r}
## Try also
View(surveys)
```

We can see this when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame with the function `str()`:

```{r}
str(surveys)
```

::: {style="background-color:#E9E2FF"}
### 6.4 More ways to inspect `data.frame` Objects *(extra material)*

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let's try them out!

**Size:**

-   `dim(surveys)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element, and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of the object)
-   `nrow(surveys)` - returns the number of rows
-   `ncol(surveys)` - returns the number of columns

**Content:**

-   `head(surveys)` - shows the first 6 rows
-   `tail(surveys)` - shows the last 6 rows

**Names:**

-   `names(surveys)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame` objects)
-   `rownames(surveys)` - returns the row names

**Summary:**

-   `str(surveys)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column
-   `summary(surveys)` - summary statistics for each column
:::

::: {style="background-color:#E4F8D6"}
**TIP**: Most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of objects besides `data.frame`.
:::

### 6.5 Indexing data frames

Our survey data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions), if we want to extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers. However, note that different ways of specifying these coordinates lead to results with different classes.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[1, 1]   
# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
surveys[1, 6]   
# first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[, 1]    
# first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[1]      
# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[3, ]    
```

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing or decreasing order.

```{r }
# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
surveys[1:3, 7] 
```

::: {style="background-color:#E9E2FF"}
**Extra material** - Test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance. You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the "`-`" sign:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys[, -1]          # The whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[-c(7:34786), ] # Equivalent to head(surveys)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

### 6.6 Subsetting data frames

Data frames can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by calling their column names directly:

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE}
surveys["species_id"]       # Result is a data.frame
surveys[, "species_id"]     # Result is a vector
surveys[["species_id"]]     # Result is a vector
surveys$species_id          # Result is a vector
```

::: {style="background-color:#E4F8D6"}
**TIP**: In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct names of the columns.
:::

::: {style="background-color:#E9E2FF"}
**Extra material** Like we've seen in the section on vectors, data frames can also be subset using logical tests:

```{r}
females <- surveys[surveys$sex=="F",]
head(females)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

## 7. Challenges - Now it's your turn!

### 7.1 Assigning values to objects

What are the values after each statement in the following? Run individual lines by putting your cursor on that line and pressing **Ctrl + Enter** or OS X: **Cmd + Enter**, this will evaluate only that line in the Console. You can check the content of an object by typing its name in the Console and pressing enter, or checking the Environment tab.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mass <- 47.5            # mass?

age  <- 122             # age?

mass <- mass * 2.0      # mass?

age  <- age - 20        # age?

mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?

```

### 7.2 Vectors

1.  We've seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric (or double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?

2.  What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to check the data type of your objects):

```{r}
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")

num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)

char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)

tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")

```

3.  Why do you think it happens?

4.  How many values in `combined_logical` are `"TRUE"` (as a character) in the following example (reusing the 2 `..._logical`s from above):

```{r}
combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)
```

5.  In R, we call converting objects from one class into another class *coercion*. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy, whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other types. From the examples above, can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how these data types are coerced?

### 7.3 Logical test

```{r}
# Reminder of logical tests:
4>5 # FALSE

"i" == "I" # FALSE

5 == "five" # FALSE

"i" %in% letters # TRUE
# letters is a vector of the alphabet (lower case)
```

1.  Can you figure out why `"four" > "five"` returns `TRUE`?

```{r}
"four" > "five"
```

### 7.4 Subsetting/Removing NAs

1.  Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, `heights_no_na`, with the NAs removed.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
```

2.  Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.

3.  Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.

```{r}
heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)

# 1.
heights_no_na <- ...

# 2.
median(...) 

# 3.
heights_above_67 <- ...
length(...) # 6
```

### 7.5 Data.frames

Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?

-   What is the class of the object `surveys`?
-   How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
-   How many species have been recorded during these surveys?

```{r, answer=TRUE, results="markup", purl=FALSE}
str(surveys)
```

#### Subsetting

1.  Create a `data.frame` (`surveys_200`) containing only the data in row 200 of the `surveys` dataset.

2.  Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a `data.frame`?

-   Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
-   Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make sure it's meeting expectations.
-   Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
-   Create a new data frame (`surveys_last`) from that last row.

3.  Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.

4.  Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of `head(surveys)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.

```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
## 1.
surveys_200 <- ...
## 2.
# Saving `n_rows` to improve readability and reduce duplication
n_rows <- ...
surveys_last <- ...
## 3.
surveys_middle <- ...
## 4.
surveys_head <- ...
```
